I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is how to convert the game from into Nim game model. I readed the
the article of Grundy Number and Sprague Grundy Theorem on geeksforgeeks, so that I find a way
to utilize recursive call and hash-set to complete the grundy number calculations. The trick part
of this assignment is about figuring out the next move which reduces the groundy number of groups and 
takes pins as left as possible. I use Depth-first Search to completely check each possible next moves
from left to right, and stores those updated number of grundy number is that route in a vector. Finishing 
this part, I then check the vector to find the minimum number of grundy number the player can get in next
move and construt the corresponding board to print out.
