I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is to use linear programming and payoff matrix to solove the equilibrium mixed strategy of this
non-cooperative game. Since the assignment already provide the table implemented by dynamic programming to store each possible
records with estimated value. We then can easily applied it to compute the payoff matrix. The trick part of this assigment is
how to correctly compute the entry value inside the payoff matrix. There is some specific restrictions of this assignment requirment
which I forget to exactly follow it to implement my program, so that I didn't get the right payoff matrix at first time. However, I
fixed this problem and make the matrix right. Since we directly use built-in linear programming fucntion provided by python, we then
can easily find the equilibrium mixed strategy.
