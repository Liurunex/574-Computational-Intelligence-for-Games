I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is how to calculate those possibilities and converting those mathmatic
forms into program. The trick of this assignment is how to compute the possibility. my intial idea of 
calculating the possibility is to use a 1-dimentional array, but later on I noticed it was not correct 
as we need to re-compute those possibility based on the target we want to achive. On the basis of that, 
I changed the possibility array into a 2-dimentional array, where each row represent the target to reach, 
the each column stands the overflow number, so that I pre-compute all
those possibilities to memorize them ahead.
