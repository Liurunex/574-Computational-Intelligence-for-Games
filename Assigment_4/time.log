I discussed my solution with: No one

The idea of this assignment is how to implement the alpha-beta pruning and how to use transposition
table to imrpove the performance of alpha-beta pruning. With the help the class note, I got the idea
of implementing the alpha-beta pruning in a short and effective way. I then followed the class note to
implement the alpha-beta version with transopotion table, which works fine for depth unlimted search
stratagy. The diffcult of this assignment is to understand and implment the alpha-beta minimax with
transposition table. However, the class note is clear and detailed on explaining it and implementation
